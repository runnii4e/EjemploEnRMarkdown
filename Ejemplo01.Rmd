### Introducción al formato R Markdown

ejemplo elaborado `r date ()`

```{r GenerarHistograma}
 set.seed(20140815)
x <- rnorm(10000, mean = 80, sd = 10)
hist(x, breaks = 100, border="white", col = gray(0.7))
abline(v = mean(x), col = "blue", lwd = 2 )

```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
